## Description
This project was created in order to help provide a way to make it easier to keep track of events during one's work day. By highlighting the current hour and showing past and future hours all in different colors, it makes it easy to get an overview of the day at a glance. By working on this project, I gained a greater understanding of how to work with the javascript library Day.js.
